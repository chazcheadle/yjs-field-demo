# yjs-field-demo
Demonstration of concurrent field editing and locking methods

This demo is meant to show some of the possible UI behaviors for a web form that multiple users can access.

Enter your name to provide a tag that others will see in their browser as you perform actions.

The fields share data via [Yjs|https://github.com/yjs] and a remote (or your own) websocket server.

The demo has a few bugs.
